    Logic:
 - read the config file: information about the config file structure \see configFileContent::operator<<	
 - for each line of the config file read the measurement file (.mct, .iv, .cv) and store them in maps:
   - one map for all the baseline measurements
   - one map for all the reference measurements
   - one map for all the measurements of irradiated diodes
 - make the average of the baselines of the same type and plot all the baseline measurements and the average one
 - subtract the baseline from each reference measurement
 - make the average of the different reference measurements of the same type -> not implemented yet, assuming only one measurement
 - subtract the baseline from each irradiated diode measurement
 - make the average of the different irradiated diode measurement -> not implemented yet, assuming only one measurement
 - plot all the spectra for the irradiated diodes
 - calculate and plot QvsV for the references
 - calculate and plot QvsV for the irradiated diodes
 - calculate and plot the CCEvsV for the irradiated diodes
