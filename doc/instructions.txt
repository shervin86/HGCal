-# Put the information about the measurements in a config file under the data/ directory according to the following syntax:
\verbatim
# diode                irradiation	Temperature	TCTdate			TCTreference		TCTreferenceDate	TCTbaseline TCTbaselineDate IVdate CVdate
FZ320N_04_DiodeL_5     -		-		19/08/2014-16:42	-			-			-	    -		    -    -

-# the program will automatically provide validation plots for all the measurements and all the samples
-# the information about the reference is used to plot the Charge Collection Efficiency (CCE)
-# the information about the baseline measurement is used to subtract the baseline from the TCT spectra




\section TCTvalidation TCT measurement on-the-fly validation
run the program with following options:
\verbatim
\endverbatim
./bin/test.cpp --tctFile youFile.mct


\section Checks Checks
 - check compatibility between baseline measurements
   - put the measurements as different baselines in a separate config file
   - check that the std. dev. of the different measurements are compatible 
   - check that mean of different measurements are compatible (i.e. difference in mean << std. dev. single measurement)
   - then you are allowed to put all the baselines together
 - check that for each reference, you have the correct baseline
   - the spectrum of each reference - baseline should have average 0 and std. dev. = to the baseline std. dev. in the region before the signal
   - check the ref_600 plot's baseline


\section IV IV measurements
- Put the measurements in the list.list config file
- Run the test.exe program
- put all the IV TGraph in one file:
\verbatim 
hadd -f t.root tmp/IV/*.root
\endverbatim
 - run the macro to make the plots


List of performed measurements from list.list file
 \code
 ./scripts/diodeMeasurementTable.sh
\endcode

remove jumping points in CV and IV measurements
 - average of 3 points before and 3 points after
 - RMS 3 points before, 3 points after
 - if point not within 1 RMS, the point is rejected
